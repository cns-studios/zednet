# ZedNet Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

ZedNet is designed for privacy, but collects minimal local data:

### Locally Stored Data
- **Audit Logs**: Security events (file access, connections, violations)
- **Content Cache**: Downloaded site content
- **Private Keys**: Cryptographic keys for sites you create
- **Reports**: Violation reports you submit

### NOT Collected
- Personal identifying information
- Browsing history (beyond local audit logs)
- Uploaded to central servers (none exist)

### Data Sharing
- **No central servers exist**
- Audit logs stay on YOUR device
- P2P connections expose your IP to peers (USE VPN)

### Your Rights
- Delete all local data by removing the `data/` directory
- Audit logs cannot be remotely accessed
- You control your private keys

## Security
- Use VPN/Tor for network anonymity
- Encrypt your disk for data-at-rest protection
- Secure your private keys

**Questions?** This is decentralized software. You are your own data controller.
