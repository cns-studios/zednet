# Netlify configuration file
# This file tells Netlify how to build and deploy your site, including serverless functions.

[build]
  # This project doesn't have a static site build command, as it's a Python app.
  # We only need to specify the functions directory.
  functions = "netlify/functions/"

# The functions section is implicitly handled by the [build] settings above,
# but you could define specific function settings here if needed.
# For example:
# [functions]
#   node_bundler = "esbuild"
#   [functions.submit-site]
#     # specific settings for the submit-site function
