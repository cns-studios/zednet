# Netlify configuration file
# This file tells Netlify how to build and deploy your site, including serverless functions.

[build]
  # This command tells Netlify to install the Node.js dependencies for our serverless functions.
  command = "cd netlify/functions && npm install"
  # This specifies where the serverless functions are located.
  functions = "netlify/functions/"

# The functions section is implicitly handled by the [build] settings above,
# but you could define specific function settings here if needed.
# For example:
# [functions]
#   node_bundler = "esbuild"
#   [functions.submit-site]
#     # specific settings for the submit-site function
